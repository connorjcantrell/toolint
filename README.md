# Toolint

Tool inventory management for individuals and organizations within the construction industry

### Considerations:
Considerations were made to keep the first iteration of this project as simple as possible to direct attention towards learning key concepts of the Go programming language and using clean design patterns.
Key areas of focus include:
- Building a PostgreSQL database with Docker
- Running migrations using the `golang-cli` tool
- Getting familiar with Go's `html/template` package
- Model/ View/ Controller design patterns
- Organize code compilation using a Makefile

### Future development
New features will be added in following versions, which will begin to offer real value to buisnesses, including:

- Integrate and view all supply channels
- Approve tool requests made by an employee
- Monitoring possession of tools throughout an organization
- Automated insurance claims for stolen tools
